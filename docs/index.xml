      <description>First Response  Link to heading   One of my interests outside of academia is learning about first response. It has always been a goal of mine to work as ski patrol and participate in moutain search and rescue. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a considerable amount of time in the mountains, during which I&amp;rsquo;ve leared how quickly things can go wrong! Learning about first response started as a necessary preparatory measure to continue to engage in extreme outdoor sports, but it has turned into a significant point of interest in my life.</description>
