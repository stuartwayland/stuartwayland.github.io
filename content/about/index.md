# About


Hi everyone! My name is Stuart (I aslo go by Stu) and I'm a 2nd year computer science PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz ([Baskin School of Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/)). I'm doing my graduate studies at such an amazing place. At the moment, I'm interested in exploring the intersectionality of mathematics and computer science, and hope to continue to study mathematics capable of bringing new perspective to familiar computer science problems. Check out my Research to see what I've been up to! 


 Before coming to Santa Cruz, I completed my undergrad at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), where I studied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Music. Growing up in Orange County, California, I've been on a slow path up this amazing California coast, and love the outdoor lifestyle it has to offer alongside my academics. Despite the rather small bubble I've confined myself to living in, I have travelled to some spectacular places around the world (Belgium, France, Ecuador, Nicaragua, South Africa, Zambia), and hope to live abroad following the completion of my studies. 

 While I don't know what the future holds for me, I can't wait to explore all that Santa Cruz has to offer!
