awards:
  - title: üìÉ Monogamy of Entanglement Bounds and Improved Approximation Algorithms for Qudit Hamiltonians
    url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15544
    date: "2024-10-08"
    awarder: QIP
    summary: |
      This work establishes new entanglement monogamy bounds for two-local qudit Hamiltonians and certifies ground state energy using sum-of-squares proofs. A simple matching-based algorithm achieves better-than-random approximations, including a 0.595 guarantee for qubits, outperforming prior results on bounded-degree graphs.
  - title: üìÉ Approximation Algorithms for Quantum Max-d-Cut
    url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15544
    date: "2023-09-19"
    awarder: QIP
    summary: |
      The Quantum Max-d-Cut problem seeks quantum states maximizing antisymmetric subspace energy in d-dimensional systems, generalizing Max-d-Cut. The authors provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with performance guarantees and prove its tightness using a gap instance for d‚â•3
  - title: üìÉ Quantifying Gerrymandering with Simulated Annealing
    url: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-with-s3-and-r6-in-r
    date: "2022-06-14"
    awarder: Undergraduate Thesis
    summary: |
      This work applies Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Simulated Annealing to detect gerrymandering, showing it effectively generates representative voting distributions. Results on Texas demonstrate its speed and reliability in identifying bias in districting plans, offering a powerful analytical tool.
